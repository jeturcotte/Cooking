# Strong Basil Spinach Pesto

* Place the following in a blender
  * `40 grams of fresh dry-weighed spinach`
  * `15 grams of fresh dry-weighed basil`
    * (weighing these dry is more accurate than weighing it wet)
    * (and far more accurate that measuring by volume!)
  * `60-65 grams of grated parmesan cheese`
  * `1/4 tsp black pepper`
  * `1/4 tsp sea salt`
  * `10-15 grams of smashed/minced garlic cloves`
  * `5 grams of lemon zest`
    * (the shaved outer skin; avoid waxed fruit for this reason)
  * `15-20 grams of fresh squeezed lemon juice`
    * (probably from the same lemon!)
  * `90 grams of pine nuts`
    * (of note; substituting `75 grams of roasted almonds` gives a different but pleasant taste and a texture more like a paste... possibly useful as a ravioli filling?)
  * `105 grams of olive oil`
    * (about a cup)
* Blend

* Store in the fridge overnight; the taste sharpens with time to cure
* Use as a sauce for pasta, or as a pizza sauce (my primary use), or even a coasting for salmon about to be pan fried!
