# Buttermilk Pancakes (for two people)

* Prepare the liquids
  * heat a small pot on low, adding `2 tablespoons of unsalted butter` to melt
  * place `3/4 cup of milk` in a measuring cup
  * add `2 tablespoons of white vinegar` to the milk
  * the time it takes for the vinegar to curdle the milk will be roughly the same as it takes for the butter to melt in the small pot on low
* Prepare the mix
  * place `1 cup of all purpose flour` in a measuring cup
  * add `1/4 teaspoon of baking powder` to the flour
  * add `1/4 teaspoon of baking soda` to the flour
  * add `1/2 teaspoon of granulated/cane sugar` to the flour
  * add `1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg` to the flour
  * whisk/sift mix together and set aside while whisk is still dry
* Prepare the batter
  * add and whisk `1 large egg` to large measuring cup (not smaller than 4 cups) or bowl
  * add curdled milk and whisk the mixture again
  * add melted butter and whisk the mixture again
  * add dry mixture on top, and whisk slowly until there is a consistent (and thick) texture
* Cook the pancakes
  * Set aside two pans (or do the following twice), adding and spreading around a small amount of oil (if you have old pans like I do)
  * Heat both about halfway through the medium range on your dial
  * Spoon half the mixture (it will be slightly uncooperative; that's not a bad sign) onto one pan, and spread it out
  * Optionally, if one of you likes coconut and the other does not, whisk `2 tablespoons of coconut shavings` into what remains
  * Spread the latter half into the second pan
  * When the bottom outside edges of eack pancake as changed in color and texture, flip over
